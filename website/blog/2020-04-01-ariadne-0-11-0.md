## Removed support for sending queries and mutations via WebSocket

Few weeks back we've merged to Ariadne a change that enabled execution of GraphQL queries and mutations over the websocket connection - a feature implemented by some GraphQL client libraries such as [apollo-link-ws](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/ws/).

Only after release we have learned that logic testing if incoming GraphQL operation is subscription or not is incorrect, classifying correct subscription payloads sent by clients as queries, making it impossible to implement subscriptions in Ariadne 0.10.

We have decided to roll-back the change in 0.11, to make sure that subscriptions are still available to users that rely on them.

We have also added the feature to our [roadmap](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/issues/341) - contributions are welcome!


## CHANGELOG

- Fixed `convert_kwargs_to_snake_case` utility so it also converts the case in lists items.
- Removed support for sending queries and mutations via WebSocket.
- Freezed `graphql-core` dependency at version 3.0.3.
- Unified default `info.context` value for WSGI to be dict with single `request` key.
