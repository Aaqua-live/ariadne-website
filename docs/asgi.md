Ariadne provides a `GraphQL` class that implements a production-ready ASGI application.


## Using with an ASGI server

First create an application instance pointing it to the schema to serve:

```python
# in myasgi.py
import os

from ariadne import make_executable_schema
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from mygraphql import type_defs, resolvers

schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, resolvers)
application = GraphQL(schema)
```

Then point an ASGI server such as uvicorn at the above instance.

Example using uvicorn:

```console
$ uvicorn myasgi:application
```


## Customizing context or root

You can customize context value passed to your resolves using `context_value` option:

```python
app = GraphQL(schema, context_value=CUSTOM_CONTEXT_VALUE)
```

`context_value` option accepts value of any type. If type is `callable` it will be called with one argument: request representation specific to your HTTP stack, and its return value will then be used as final context value:

```python
def get_context_value(request):
    return {"user": request.user, "conf": request.conf}

app = GraphQL(schema, context_value=get_context_value)
```

To set custom root value passed as parent to root resolvers (resolvers defined on `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscribe` types) `root_value`:

```python
app = GraphQL(schema, root_value=CUSTOM_ROOT_VALUE)
```

`root_value` option accepts value of any type. If type is `callable` it will be called with two arguments: `context` and `document` that is currently executed query already parsed to `DocumentNode`. Its return value will then be used as final root value:

```python
def get_root_value(context, document):
    return {"user": context["user"]}

app = GraphQL(schema, root_value=get_root_value)
```
